Salesforce can be compared to an Excel spreadsheet.

CRM: Customer Relationship Management
 

**Record:** An item you're tracking in your database; if your data is like a spreadsheet, then a record is a row on the spreadsheet

**Field:** A place where you store a value, like a name or address; using our spreadsheet example, a field would be a column on the spreadsheet

**Object:** A table in the database; in that spreadsheet example, an object is a tab on the spreadsheet

**Org:** Short for “organization,” the place where all your data, configuration, and customization lives. You and your users log in to access it. You might also hear this called 
         “your instance  of Salesforce”

**App:** A set of fields, objects, permissions, and functionality to support a business process


Some core standard _objects_ in Salesforce and description

**Leads** are potential prospects. You haven’t yet qualified that they're ready to buy or what product they need

**Opportunities** are qualified leads that you’ve converted. When you convert the Lead, you create an Account and Contact along with the Opportunity.

**Accounts** are the companies you’re doing business with

**Contacts** are the people who work at an Account
